Built a multiple linear regression-based car price prediction model to estimate vehicle prices based on key features. 🚗📈

This project allowed me to dive deep into regression algorithms and apply advanced statistical techniques to predict car prices accurately using multiple independent variables.

✨ Key Highlights:

🎯 Multiple Linear Regression: Modeled the relationship between car prices and multiple features such as mileage, engine size, and horsepower.

🧑‍💻 Data Processing: Cleaned, prepared, and engineered datasets using Python libraries like pandas and NumPy.

📊 Model Training: Trained and evaluated the regression model using scikit-learn to optimize performance and minimize prediction error.

💡 Insights Generation: Analyzed feature importance to understand how various car attributes influence price predictions.

📈 Visualization: Visualized prediction results and model performance using Matplotlib for better interpretability.

Excited to further explore predictive modeling techniques and apply machine learning to solve real-world business problems! 🚀
